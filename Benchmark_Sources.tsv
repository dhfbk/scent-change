brewing/beer	XVI century	The production of the beer is a domestic activity (the odour of the beer is linked with the domestic environment, private and familiar). In this period it is a seasonal odour, asscoiated with some festivities and, especially, with the winter. This is due to the fact that the preservation of this product was only possible with cold temperatures. 	XVIII-XIX century	From middle '800 refrigeration is introduced (scientific brewing) and then the odour of the beer loses its seasonality and it is present all the year.

A cultural History of Odours 2) https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_candle_making	During Middle Age, candle production was associated with disagreeable odors because the material that has been used was the pig tallow (reference 1). During time, tehy tried to solve the problem of the odour by using different materials: the spermaceti oil from 1700, and the paraffin wax from 1830 (reference 2).

incense 	From 1530 (anglican scism under Henry the VIIIth)	Incense started to be refused from XVIth century in the protestant churches. The use of the incense is condamned as an element linked with superstition and idolatry. Anyway, it is still used in specific occasions, such as the coronation of the sovereigns in Westminster (reference 5).  Before 1800 incense and frankincense indicate the same thing. 	From XVII/XVIIIth century 	Metaphorical use in the social relationship realm: incense is considered as a kind of flattery. This documented the use of the incense that moves from churches to houses. It started to be used in the domestic environment (reference 5:  pastilles, sometimes composed of frankincense, were being produced by a domestic market to be burnt in homes.)  From XVIIIth century, a doctor of London reccomended people to burn frankincense at home to prevent epidimics. 	XIXth century 	It started to be used in theaters as part of the representation.  It is also more and more associated with esoterism, magic, and superstition thanks to its inebriating properties.	Topic --> church/house		Tullet 2019, p. 121: Before the Reform, incense had an important role in the catholic liturgy, cretaing a sense of group identification and indicating the spiritual presence of the divine. With the reform of Henry the VIIIth, then of Edoard the VIth and under Elisabeth the Ist (XVIth century), the use of incense was explicitly condamned as source of idolatry (especially when the worshipped divinities were wood pieces or rocks). However, incense does not disappear: there exist proofs for the fact that it is still used in the ecclesiastical environment, also during the coronation of sovereigns.   It also seems that during the XVIIIth century, "the burning of incense came to be associated with luxury rather than religion." (p.123 Tullet 2019).   The metaphor by which incense is a kind of flattery started to be used. 	- churches (not protestant from XVIth century) - monarchic and ecclesiastical ceremonies (also for the enhancement of memory) - recipes to fumigate ships and houses - recipes for insecticides (e.g. recipes to remove spiders) - therapeutic use (purifying and healer) - in the streets, during processions - theaters (as part of the representation) - esoterism, magic, and superstition (inebriating properties) --> Victorian spiritualism

ozone	From 1840	The word "ozone"appears as a term to describe the odour that originates during electrical experiments. It is an odour also described in the XVIIIth century, when people started to work with electricity, but it is called with another name ("electrical odour"), also associated with thunder and lightning  	From the XXth century	It spreads the idea that the ozone was the responsible for the healthy properties of the mountain and sea air.  It is an odour also evoked in several practices: domestic cleaning, industrial production, laboratory science, conservation of refrigreated elements.    It decreases over time the certainty about the characteristic of its odour. 	After 	It decreases the use as a descriptor of smells.

This tendency is also reflected into recipes of perfumes found in the manuscripts and in the prints that describes solid smell sources, such as the pomander (which is a carrier), the burnt perfumes, and the perfumed gloves. After 1700, smell sources are usually more liquid (e.g. ointments, spirit, essences, eau de perfume and so on).

sulphur 	XVII-XVIIIth century 	Sulphur is present in several recipes for ointments and lotions to avoid the plague. Mixtures with sulphur are thrown on the corpses of the plague victims to avoid the spread of the disease.   From XVIIIth century, it is used as gunpowder  	XIXth century 	In Paris, it is used during the treatment of the wastewater and it is important for the ventilation of the areas considered contagious and dangerous for the health.   It is also an element vastly present in the commercial trade because of its war use (gunpowder) and its increasing industrial use. 			Topic --> medicinal/war, industry	Encyclopaedia Entry "Sulphur"	Hell: the odour of sulphur (similar to rotten eggs) is present during the volcanic activity, and it is then associated with eruptions. For this reason it is associated with hell, since the odour of the subterranena volcanos is sulphurous. This idea of sulphur as correlated with hell is already maintained in the ancient world, in the christian mithology. Heretics, devil's devoted and witches are recognised also for the odour of sulphur.  Therapeutical use: Throughout all the story of humankind , sulphur has been used as a remedy for skin deseases before and breathing ones after. Even these days, sulphur is used in some therapeutical treatments.  Perfume ingredient  Ingredient for fumigates: fumigates with sulphur were useful in the treatment of venereal diseases and then of the plague. Moreover, these fumigates were used as antiparasitic for different places: among others, ships, storage rooms, and facilities employed to preserve food.	-volcanic regions - ships, storage rooms, facilities employed to preserve food (use of sulphur-based pesticides in the XXth century to move away rats from European cities) -battlefields: sulphur used for gunpowder (XVIIIth century)
tea	From 1630-1640 (the entrance in Europe) 	Tea was exotic and unknown, not really pleasant to european taste of that epoch.   Mercantile field: it was imported.	From the end of XVIIth century 	Several authors started to describe the odour of tea as pleasant, already in the middle of the XVIIth century. It is classified into three types: bohe, singlo and bing (this last one is the most pleasant among the three).	XIXth century 	It started to be a common odour in European houses. It started to be considered the odor of home by the european which travelled around. In the novels of 1900 the odor of tea is associated with sentiment of nostalgia, or the intimity of the house (domestic comfort) vs. the outside world.

tobacco	1600-1730	Tobacco is the typical odour of coffe houses, having a public dimension which aggregates men. In facts, in this period tobacco is  a symbol of manliness and strength.  	1731-1800	The prevaling manner of the period is to please other people and so we assist to the rise of snuff, which unlike tobacco smoke, does not spread any odor in the environment.   Reference 6: pipe-smoking was deemed impolite in some late-eighteenth-century coffee houses. Perception shift: the descriptions are more and more negatives with adjectives such as "disgusting", "nauseating", "unpleasant" and so on. It started to appear more terms related to this new form of consumption which does not involve smoke release, suhc as "pinch of snuff" and "snuff boxes". 	1801-1900	There is a passagge from a public dimension to a general one which also involves a more common consumption of tobacco smoke in the domestic walls.

wig	From 1620 (1660 in UK)	In France, the wig was introduced by king Louis the XIIIth. In UK, it was firts introduced by king Charled the IInd after 1660. Wigs started to be considered as a status symbol for nobles and middle classes.	XVIII century	This is the period in which wigs had their major circulation. Wigs were perfumed and powdered with various essences. In the coffee-houses, wigs absorbed the odour of tobacco in a mesure that it became proverbial: an odour strongly pervasive is often compared to that of tobacco on wigs (reference 5, p. 141) 	End of XVIIIth century (French Revolution) 	Wigs decreased in use since as a symbol of splendour and aristrocratic power, they have no more reason to be in contrast with the new revolutionary french ideas.
