See through yon opening glade a glittering scene , Lawns ever gay , and meadows ever green ; Then ask the groves , and ask the vocal bowers , Who deck ' d their spiry lops with blooming flowers , Taught the blue stream o ' er sandy vales to flow , And the brown wild with liveliest hues to glow ? Fair Solima ! the hills and dales will sing ; light , By day a sun , a beaming moon by night ; [ ray .	1845	bl4222

Poverty and want surround thee , Thou the son of the Most High , Horned oxen feed around thee , And beside thy pillow lie !

Th ' Heavens are Avith thee — yet , oh wonder On my knees I rock thee now , Watching o ' er thy peaceful slumber , As around the cold Avinds blow ! Hush ! my love ; for here no danger Can disturb thy tranquil sleep , O ' er this rude and wretched manger Holy angels vigil keep ! 83 And first of all ye must discard Every doubt , and question hard , That human knowledge closer brings To the first origin of things , Than is allow ' d by sovereign Jove , Who reigns all mortal sense above .	1840	bl4339

Will the breezy call of incensebreathing incensebreathing morn no more convey the scent of new - mown grass or fragrant clover ?

Blessing , Glory , Wisdom , Power , Honour , Might , and Majesty , iu this thanksgiving hour ; Unto God for ever , aud for ever , now as then , And with united voice they all cried out a loud Amen ! And one of the Elders said , in questioning of me , Who are they , aud whence came they , iu white robes I see ; And I answered Him , my Lord , thou knowest them so well , That thou needest not inquire of me , for thou canst surely tell : These are they from tribulation , whose robes The Lamb did wash , And took away their foulness , their filth , aud all their trash ; They now are seated round The Throne , to serve Him day and night His Tabernacle their protection , He will guard them aright : They shall lmuger no more , neither thirst any more , And the sun shall not strike them , with heat , on any shore ; For The Lamb is in the midst of them , Shepherd of His sheep , A Fountain of Life ' s waters , their eyes shall no more weep : And when He opaued the Seventh Seal , all in Heaven was so still , You might have heard the gentlest murmur of the mountain rill ; For the space of half an ^ hour , dead silence did obtain , Then The Seven Angels stood , with Trumpets in their train : 20 0 Lord - God - Almighty , take now Thy Power again , Which is , and was , and shall be , ' tis just that Thou should ' st reign Give to Thy faithful Servants , their promised reward , The Prophets , Saints , small and great , whom Thy Faith did guard The Temple of our God was opened , in the Heaven ' s Height , The - Ark - of - the - Covenant , was visible to the sight ; And there followed Lightnings , Thuuderings , making men wail , Also the dreadful earthquake , and heavy falling hail : And a great sign in Heaven , now , distinctly was seen , A Woman , clothed with the sun , as tho ' she were a Queen ; The moon was underneath her feet , aud on her head a crown , Consisting of twelve stars , whose shining rays came down : With child , she cried out , to give it birth , in her pain , She wished to be delivered , and to be at - rest again ; And another sign in Heaven , a creature of some fame , A monster on the Earth — The Red - Dragon was his name : The Beast had Seven heads , and it also had ten horn , And upon the Seven heads , seven diadems were worn ; His tail draweth a third part of the stars iu his train , Which he cast , most unmercifully , to the Earth again : And the Dragon stood before the Woman , in her travail - hour , That when she was delivered , the Child he might devour ; And when she had given birth , it was found to be a Son , A Mau - Child , of perfect form , on Earth his course begun : Being prophesied , to rule all nations , with an Iron - Rod , The Child was caught up into Heaven , to The - Throue - of - God ; And the Woman fled into the wild , a place prepared for her , By God , and nourished two hundred days and threescore : And there was War in Heaven , Michael and his Angels fought , The Dragon and his Angels warred — a lesson them was taught ; As they prevailed not , a place in Heaven was not found , And they , with the old Dragon , were cast down to the ground : 38 And he saith unto me , see that thou do it not , I am Fellow - servant with thee , and a Brother Prophet ; One of them that keep the words , written iu this Book , Worship God , and The Lamb , whom the world forsook : Seal not up The Book , he also said unto me , For the time is now at - hand , for the words of prophesy ; He that is unrighteous , let him be unrighteous still , And he that is filthy , let him take of filth his fill : But he that is holy , let him be made holy still , Behold , I come quickly , to reward and not to kill ; According to his work , Alpha and Omega will defend , I am The First and The Last , The Beginning and The End : Blessed are they who wash their robes , that they may have right , To come to The Tree - of - Life , in God ' s Holy sight ; That they may enter in , by the jewelled City - gates , For without there are profane things , aud every thing that hates I , The Lord - Jesus , have sent my Angel to testify , Unto you , for The Churches , the things that are nigh ; I am The Root of David , and The bright morning star , The offspring of Israel , and I come from afar : And The Spirit , and The Bride , unto you say come !

And no one in the Heaven , or on the Earth was found , To open , and to look upon , the Book that had been bound ; And I wept much in agony , till an Elder said to me , The Lion of Judah ' s Tribe — the Root of David — it is He : And I saw , in the midst of the Throne set up above , The four liviug creatures , and the Elders — The - Lamb - of - love ; Standing as if slain , with seven horns and seven eyes , The Seven Spirits of God , to Earth sending their cries : And He came and took the Book , He had in His right hand , Of Him that sat upon the Throne , and there He took His stand ; Then the four and twenty Elders , each in his stately gown , And the four living creatures , with them , all fell down : They had Harps in their hands , each a Bowl of sweet Incense , To render praise to God , which are the prayers of Saints ; And they sing their new song , that none could ever give , But they whose names are writteu in The Lamb ' s Book , to live : Worthy is the Lamb , to take the Book , they cried aloud , And the Incense ascended , as a mighty fragrant cloud ; To break the Seals thereof , Thou hast purchased with Thy Blood , All Tribes and nations of the Earth , to make them very good : And the voice of many Angels , around the Throne I heard , Whilst the Elders , and the creatures , took up The - Living - Word ; To God a Kingdom of His Priests , to reign upon the Earth , That The - Temple - of - the - Lord , should never know a dearth : And the number was ten thousand thousands multiplied by ten , Who took up The - Everlasting - Song , that echoed loud again ; Worthy is the Lamb , that was slain , to receive power , Riches , Wisdom , Might , Honour , in this triumph hour : 37 And no Temple was therein , occupying the ground , For The Lord - God - Almighty , and The Lamb , is only found ; The City hath no need of Sun , nor Moon , in it to shine , For The - Glory - of - God did lighten it , The Lamb ' s Light , so fine : And the Nations walk amidst the Light , and all the Kings bring , Their glory into it , their gold , and every precious thing ; And the gates thereof , in no wise , shall be shut by day , No night being there , they shall be open , now and for aye : And the glory and the honour of the Nations shall be brought , But entrance of the unclean shall never more be sought ; And he that maketh abomination , and forgeth a lie , Not being written in The - Book - of - Life , The Lamb shall deny : And he shewed me the River , of The - Water - of - life , So peacefully quiescent , and ever free from strife ; Gently flowing as a crystal stream , at The Lamb ' s feet , Proceeding from The - Throne - of - God , and trickling down the street And on this side of the River , and on that was Life ' s Tree , Bearing twelve manner of fruits , each month did see ; And the leaves of the Tree , were the Nations to heal , As curative medicines , to act for their weal : There shall be no more curse , there God ' s Throne shall be , And His ServantSjdoing service , His Face shall ever see ; His name in their foreheads , there shall be no more night , For all shall be visible to their transparent sight : And he said unto me , these words are faithful and true , Which The - Lord - God of the Spirits , and Prophets sends you ; By His Angel , unto His Servants , the things soon to be , Blessed is he that keepeth the words of the Prophesy : And I am he that heard , and saw these things , even John , He said , Behold I come , quickly , so He ' ll not be very long ; Aud when I heard and saw , I fell down at His feet , To worship the Angel , and him to fondly greet : 13 When he opened the Sixth Seal , the Earth began to quake , And all the creatures round about immediately did shake ; The Sun became as black as night , as sackcloth of hair , And the whole moon , as blood , did the transformation share : Then the glittering Stars of Heaven unto the low Earth fell , There was such a consternation , what was coming none could tell ; As a Fig - tree casteth forth , her unripe fruits to ground , Immature aud worthless , as though they were not sound : And the Heaven was removed , as a scroll rolled aside , And the mountains , and Islands , were hurled far - and - wide ; And the Kings of the Earth , and Princes sought the cave , Perchance they might escape , each wished himself to save : And the Captains , and the Rich , both Bondmen and the Free , Looked about in terror , knowing not whither to flee ; Fall on us , they cried , for The - Day - of - Wrath is near , The Wrath of the Lamb of God o ' erwhelms us all with fear : After this I saw four Angels , standing on the Earth , The four corners holding , where the four winds have birth ; That no wind should blow , on the Earth and on the Sea , The command was , in effect , that no wind shake a tree : I saw another Angel , ascend from the rising - sun , Who had The - Seal - of - God with him , that judgment had begun ; Aud he cried , with a great voice , unto the Angels four , To whom was given to hurt the Earth , the Sea , and sea - shore : Saying : — Hurt not the Earth , and hurt not the Sea , Till we seal the servants of our God , hurt not a tree ; Iu their foreheads they were sealed , and the number was given , A hundred and forty four thousand , sealed for Heaven : Of Judah ' s Tribe twelve thousand , and of Reuben ' s the same , The chosen People of the Lord , and Israel was their name ; Of Gad , Asher , Naphtali , twelve thousand each He took , Aud their names were clearly written in The Great Redeemer ' s Book : 12 On the Earth , aud in the Heaven , each created thing , Heard I , saying these words , that made the Heavens ring ; To Him that sitteth on the Throne , and to the Lamb be given , Dominion , and Blessings , till Heaven and Earth be riven : And the four living creatures having said Amen , The four and twenty elders knelt and worshipped Him again ; And so , in this final act , their thanks did ascend , To His Majesty who sits - on - high , and so the scene did end : And I saw when the Lamb opened one of the Seven Seals , And 1 heard one of the four creatures say , as thunder peals ; Come ! and I saw a White - Horse , He thereon had a Bow , Aud a crowu to Him was given , and the order , Conquer Thou : Come ! said the Second , when he opened the second Seal , And a Red - Horse came forth , showing all was not weal ; And he that sat thereon had a sword to make great dearth , To slay his fellow - man , and to take peace off the earth : Come ! said the Third — He ope ' d the third seal with his hand , And a .	1895	bl014440

Can our Generosi ∣ ty be ever more seasonably employ ' d than in endeavouring to please him in extraordinary Measures , whose Pleasure is to see us happy even while we please him ? For so is the will of the wise and good Governour of the World , that in serving him we should serve our selves , and like Adam in his dressing and cultivation of Para ∣ dise , at the same time discharge the Employ ∣ ment which God sets us about , and consult our own Convenience : So that it fares with us in our religious Exercises as with the Votary that sacrifices at the Altar , who all the while he pleases and serves his God , enjoys the perfumes of his own Incense .	1687	ee037039

Shall I not patiently bear momentany Sorrows , while I believe I am hastening to Eternal Joys ? Did I look more to the Everlasting World , should I not make the pleasing of God , in order to my Eternal welfare , the great business of my Life ? Should I not serve the Lord with more fervency of Spirit , and be better fortified against the fears of man , who can but hurt and kill the Body , nor that neither , without the permission of God ? Should I not or ∣ der all my affairs , answer all Temptati ∣ ons , mortifie inward Lusts , live in the Exercise of Grace , and in circumspect persevering Obedience , in order to it ? Should I not watch more over my Heart , and Lips and Ways , be more diligent to trim my Lamps , more crucified to this world , more careful to call my self fre ∣ quently to an account , and renew my Re ∣ pentance ? Would not my converse be more useful and edifying , my discourses more savory and full of Religion , my Prayers to God more humble and earnest , my Charity to men more unfeigned and extensive , and my preparations every way more suitable to such a Faith , and to such apprehensions of an Everlasting State ? Could we carry the thoughts of Eternity about with us every day , and often admit them in our civil and secular affairs , did we repeat it frequently to our selves , at least every Morning , as soon as we are a ∣ wake , that we are near Eternity ; this grain of Incense would perfume the whole Temple ; and be an Antidote against in ∣ ward Lust , and impure Thoughts , a ∣ gainst the Infection and defilement of bad Company , and the snares of world ∣ ly Business , and do much to prevent vain and sensual actions , and to cure vain affe ∣ ctions .	1689	ee037491
their incense	smels	sweet	If you look upon the promise of life , Do this and live : What comfort can you find in it , ex ∣ cept you could find doing in your selves ? And can any man living find such exact obedience as the Law requires ? There is a mistake among many , They conceive that the Lord cannot be well pleased with them , if they do what they can : but be not deceived , the law of God requires perfect doing , it will not com ∣ pound with thee , and came down in its tearms , not one jot of the rigour of it will be remitted : If you can ∣ not do all that is commanded , all you do will not sa ∣ tisfie that promise ; therefore thou must be turned o ∣ ver from the promise of life to the curse , and there thou shalt find thy name written : Therefore it is ab ∣ solutely necessary , that Jesus Christ be made under the Law , and give obedience in all things , even to the death of the Crosse , and so be made a curse for us and sin for us , even he who knew no sin , and thus in him you find the law fulfilled , Justice satisfied , and God pleased ; in him you find the promise of life , indeed established , in a better , surer way than was first pro ∣ pounded , you find life by his death , you find life in his dying for you : And again consider the Ceremo ∣ nial Law , What were all those Sacrifices and Cere ∣ monies ? Did God delight in them ? Could he sa ∣ vour their incense , and sweet smels , and eat the fat of Lambs and be pacified ? No , he detastes and abhorres such imaginations , because that people did stay in the Letter , and went no further then the Ceremony ; he declares , that it was as great abomination to him as the offering up of a Dog , while they were separa ∣ ted from Jesus Christ , in whom his soul rested , and was pacified ; they were not expiatious , but provoca ∣ tious ; they were not propitiations for sin , but abomi ∣ nations in themselves .	1666	ee037655

incense	perfume		That I may summe up many reasons in one ; God by requi ∣ ring the heart secures the perpetuity and perseverance of our duty , and its sincerity , and its integrity , and its perfection : for so also God takes account of little things ; it being all one in the heart of man , whether maliciously it omits a duty in a small instance or in a great ; for al ∣ though the expression hath variety and degrees in it in relation to those purposes of usefulnesse and charity whither God designs it , yet the obedience and disobedience is all one , and shall be equally accounted for ; and therefore the Jew Tryphon disputed against Ju ∣ stin , that the precepts of the Gospell were impossible to be kept , because it also requiring the heart of man did stop every egression of disorders : for making the root holy and healthfull , as the Bal ∣ same of Judaea , or the drops of Manna in the evening of the sab ∣ bath ; it also causes that nothing spring thence but gummes sit for incense , and oblations for the Altar of proposition , and a cloud of perfume fit to make atonement for our sins , and being united to the great sacrifice of the world to reconcile God and man together .	1653	ee034704
the incense of the al ∣ tar	smell	sweet	Now the things of this world are difficult and uneasie , full of thornes , and empty of pleasures , they fill a disea ∣ sed faculty , or an abused sense , but are an infinite dissatisfaction to reason , and the appetites of the soul : they are short , and tran ∣ sient , and they never abide , unlesse sorrow like a chain be bound about their leg , and then they never stir , till the grace of God and religion breaks it , or else that the rust of time eats the chain in pie ∣ ces : they are dangerous and doubtfull , few and difficult , sordid and particular , not onely not communicable to a multitude , but not diffusive upon the whole man ; there being no one pleasure or object in this world , that delights all the parts of man : and after all this , they are originally from earth , and from the creatures , onely that they oftentimes contract alliances with hell and the grave , with shame and sorrow ; and all these put together make no great ama ∣ bility , or proportion to a wise mans choice : But on the other side , the things of God are the noblest satisfactions to those desires , which ought to be cherished and swelled up to infinite ; their deli ∣ ciousnesse is vast and full of relish , and their very appendant thorns are to be chosen , for they are gilded , they are safe and medicinall , they heal the wound they make , and bring forth fruit of a blessed and a holy life : The things of God and of religion are easie and sweet , they bear entertainments in their hand , and reward at their back , their good is certain and perpetual , and they make us cheer ∣ full to day , and pleasant to morrow ; and spiritual songs end not in a sigh and a groan ; neither like unwholesome physick do they let loose a present humour , and introduce an habitual indispositi ∣ on : But they bring us to the felicity of God , the same yesterday , and to day , and for ever ; they do not give a private and particu ∣ lar delight , but their benefit is publike , like the incense of the al ∣ tar , it sends up a sweet smell to heaven , and makes atonement for the religious man that kindled it , and delights all the standers by , and makes the very air wholesome ; there is no blessed soul goes to heaven , but he makes a generall joy in all the mansions where the Saints do dwell , and in all the chappels where the Angels sing : and the joyes of religion are not univocal , but productive of rare and accidental , and praeternatural pleasures ; for the musick of holy hymnes delights the ear , and refreshes the spirit , and makes the very bones of the Saint to rejoyce : and charity , or the giving alms to the poor , does not onely ease the poverty of the receiver , but makes the giver rich , and heals his sicknesse , and delivers from death ; and temperance though it be in the matter of meat , and drink , and pleasures , yet hath an effect upon the understanding and makes the reason sober , and his will orderly , and his affecti ∣ ons regular , and does things beside , and beyond their natural and proper efficacy ; for all the parts of our duty are watered with the showers of blessing , and bring forth fruit according to the influ ∣ ence of heaven , and beyond the capacities of nature .	1653	ee034704

How thanklesse is their labour , that do wilfully ouer ∣ spend themselues in their ordi ∣ nary vocations ? As Zachary had a course in Gods house , so he carefully obserued it ; The fa ∣ uour of these respites doubled his diligence : The more high and sacred our calling is , the more dangerous is our neglect : It is our honor , that wee may be allowed to waite vpon the God of heauen in these immediate seruices : Woe be to vs , if wee slacken those duties , wherein God honors vs more , then wee can honor him .	1618	ee040989

Whiles they were praying to God , he sees an Angell of God As Gedeons Angell went vp in the smoake of the sacrifice , s did Zacharies Angell ( as it were ) come downe in the fragrant smoke of his incense : It was euer great newes to see an Angell of God , but now more ; because God had long with - drawne from them all the meanes of his supernaturall reuelations : As this wicked people were stran ∣ gers to their God in their con ∣ uersation , so was God growne a stranger to them in his appariti ∣ ons ; yet now , that the season of the Gospell approched , he visi ∣ ted them with his Angels , before hee visited them by his sonne : He sends his Angell to men in the forme of man , before hee sends his sonne to take humane forme : The presence of Angels is no nouelty , but their appari ∣ tion ; they are alwaies with vs , but rarely seene , that wee may awfully respect their messages , when they are seene ; In the meane time our faith may see them , though our senses do not ; their assumed shapes doe not make them more present , but visible .	1618	ee040989

Incense|it	perfuming|smell	sweet	This is the life of feeling in grace ( after the measure of the gift ) with a reverend beholding him spi ∣ ritually , without which ( in some measure ) all is but deceitfull , and no ∣ thing worth , nor any way of good use , but hurtfull ; for as the soul is the light and life of the body , so is Jesus Christ the light and life of the soul , by his gracious presence , which cannot so well be exprest as felt ; for it is the light , life , love , joy , strength and rest of the soul that hath painfully felt it ; yet with sweetness , insomuch that it cannot cease from desiring it : — And this is , that no man may mistake in or concerning the work of grace in his own soul ; and he who will remain still filthy , may bear his own burthen ( whatever he be ) and his shame also ; for God hath not left himself without a witness in every man , neither is he wanting to any , though ( as Christ said ) The holy Ghost inspireth where and when he will , and that privily ( as the wind blow ∣ eth ) oft - times when men are least aware of him , but is known by his stirring and turning the heart into a beholding of his goodness , and melting it into softness of love , & amp ; yet wondereth at his highness & amp ; shi ∣ ning brightness : but the substance & amp ; effect of this shining grace remai ∣ neth ( though not in its fervour ) while the soul is kept clean without fallings ( by wilfulness or negligence ) into a dissolute life of fleshliness and outward vanity ; — and also know , that the soul which is unac ∣ quainted with the touches of spirituall grace , is an enemy to all spiri ∣ tuall works , as being old , dry , rotten , barren , and without savour in it self ; for the salt hath there no savour , and to be trodden under foot , and nothing but the light of grace ( through touching ) maketh it lively , sharp , quick , subtil , ready and able to spirituall work , by gi ∣ ving it great freedome , and a holy readiness in will and affections to obey all the stirrings of grace in the soul , and to watch thereto for o ∣ pening of the spirituall eye , whereby it becomes apt to meditation , watching and prayer , but not to pray in the common manner it did before , with loud voyce , many words , and other mens speakings , but in stilness of the voyce , and tenderness of heart , & amp ; being gathered up into it self , and in the spirituall presence of Jesus Christ , wherein every word and syllable hath a savoury sweet sound , and delectable melody in the heart by the holy Spirit ; as being wholly entered into the fire of love , the powers of the soul being all heated and inflamed with love , so that the sparks flie upward , whence the fire came ; and therein is the soul so comfortably enlightned , that it knowes not how to leave off watching , praying , and praising God , with spirituall delight and hea ∣ venly joy , when no matter is seen outwardly , nor voyce heard : And this is the food and nourishment of the soul , and of much vertue a ∣ gainst temptations and likings of the world ; for it beareth up both soul and body from painfull heaviness of heart , and feeling of the wretched ∣ ness of this earthly life , and the soul is thereby kept quick and lively : This was Davids prayer as Incense ascending and perfuming the soul , and so as any hath a Psalm of the spirit , which is savoury and soft , sweet and pleasant , in the pure mind , broken and burning heart , it giveth up a sweet smell to the face of our Lord Jesus Christ : these are the prayers and praises , heard and accepted of God , ( as before hath been said ) yielding and also receiving grace from him , which he ac ∣ cepts as an addition to his Glory ; and all other praying wants savour and sweetness , as a speaking of words with the tongue , when the heart is gone after other lovers , or likings of fleshly things , and the soul is not master of the bodily wits , and imaginations of the brain , and is that wherein is no constant devotion , no free om of spirit , no ardent and burning love and affections , nor whole mind ; but much spea ∣ king and running about here and there by words ( seeming to speak of spirituall matters ) without savour , profit , or any soul - satisfaction , and therefore hear with me a few words more of this weighty business of Prayer , and keep first to silence and firm watchfulness , that thou maist first come to a joyfull feeling of this spirituall praying , and that shall teach thee unchangable wisdome , without fancy or faine ness ( that those are possessed with that speak well or ill of things they know not ) and therefore abide therein , untill grace come into thy soul otherwise , and will remove it in part for a time , and employ thee otherwise ; and then therein be obedient , for that is the best of all sacrifices , whereby the holy God will be served ; and so there is no need of mans teaching how to pray or praise him , what words to speak , how to divide duties into parts , or to guide the affections ; for the holy Spirit teacheth all this , and much more , as he pleaseth ; and the soul feeleth it self led thereby to enjoy Jesus Christ in some measure : but this praying and praising God with the Spirit and understanding , the wise world ac ∣ counts foolishness , and ( being strangers to it ) would have others continue so likewise .	1661	ee048310

of holy incense|a	smelling|smelling savour	sweet smelling|smelling	that we beware of the subtilty of the old Scrpent ; and the craft of a new Generation of Vi ∣ pers , who lie in wait to deceive ; that we take heed of the cunning wiles , the curious arts and Methods , the industrious con ∣ trivances , the ingenious sophisms of error and sedi ∣ tion : By these two hints , we may both examine our selves , and be circumspect , as to others ; know a false Zeal , should either we be carried away with it ; or we may discover it in any one else , should they seduce us by it ; And they are these : Is not the Zeal pretended , the product of Passion more than Piety , the result of the Bodies Gonstitution , more then a virtuous habit and frame of Mind ? and again , is not the Thing for which there is so much Zeal , more the Zealots interest , then his Devotion ? Is he not a more laborious slave to his worldly profit , than a diligent servant to his Gracious God ? First , Is not the Zeal the product of Passion more then Piety , the result chiefly of the Bodies Constitution , rather then of a Virtuous habit and frame of Mind ? that Zeal which is the consequence of mans temper is to be suspect for choler ; as is moderation for lukewarmness , which proceeds from an easie facil Disposition ; we are not to ascribe that to Piety ( says a late excellent pen ) which a man owes to his Complexion , and think Religion makes him zealous , when it is his Constitution : Not , by the way , but that a Mans Natural Disposition may be Sanctified , and God may , and does make use of our tempers and inclinations in order to his service ; yet , there is cause enough of suspition , when the passions are not regulated , or ( in the language of the Apostle , rather then the Philosopher ) when we have not crucified the affections and the lusts : that zeal is not kindled by a coal from the Altar , in which iniquity is not done away ; the lips are still unclean , when in other circumstances of life , there are the same heats , nothing but choler and anger , and that violent , and long continued , upon every little , or no occasion : They , whose hearts are a sacrifice of holy incense , a pure flame , a burnt - offering , a sweet smelling savour , acceptable unto God , cannot spare any of their heat upon outward provocations ; they can pass by injuries unconcern ∣ ed and be quiet ; so God may have his honour in ∣ tire , they value not their own ; they have not gi ∣ ven up their understanding to their splene ; love and charity is the Rule they walk by amongst men , and though many times they shew themselves con ∣ cerned in the cause of God , yet it is not so much a fretful humour , running in their blood , as the over ∣ flowing and circulation of Grace from the heart : in a word , it is a zeal for Gods House , that it may stand , not a design to promote their own house , that it may be exalted higher which doth thus Consume them ; and that is the Second Note of distinction , whereby we may know , and beware of a false Zeal ; Is not the thing , for which there is so much zeal , more the Zealots in ∣ terest , then his Devotion ? is he not more a labori ∣ ous slave to his worldly Mammon , then a diligent servant to his gracious God ? And this is that which renders zeal , though for a good thing , it self to be bad : The Devil thought it a sufficient Plea against Job , that he did not serve God for nought ; none was like Job for prosperity , which he knew to be the result of his Piety , God hedged him in on every side ; no wonder , if none were like him in all the earth , for his integrity , one that feared God an es ∣ chewed evil : Had not they reason , think you , those who made Silver shrines for Diana , to set the whole City in an uproar , in the defence of their great God ∣ dess , in so much that nothing else could be heard for two hours together , but this Out - cry , Great is the Diana of the Ephesians , whom not only Ephesus , but the whole world worshippeth ? Many men have their Religion tied at their Purse - strings ; and , be the thing good or bad , for which they contend , if it once comes to make for their profit , they are soon induced to espouse the quarrel , and they shall man ∣ age it with too much eagerness : But , true Zeal for God , and for his Glory is not of so low , and so sordid a principle , it doth not run in the veins of the earth , but it is a fire fetched from heaven , a beam , or a ray from the Sun of Righteousness .	1670	ee012156

Frankincense	fumed		There was once at Pharis , a City of Achaia , in the middle of the Market , a statue of Mercury ; where he that went to receive omen , did , Frankincense being fumed , and candles being ligh ∣ ted , which was set before it , and that Countrey Coyne being offered on the right hand of the statue , whisper into the right care of the statue , whatsoever he would demand ; and pre ∣ sently , his eares being stopped with both his hands , did make baste away from the Market - place ; which when he was past , did presently , his eares being opened , observe the first voyce he did heare from any man , for a certaine Oracle given unto him .	1657	ee033671

incenses|incenses	odours|incenses|incenses|smels	sweet|very excellentest|sweet	Furthermore , if the Archeus be so con ∣ sidered to retire , that a poyson enters in his place , and in this respect shall supplant the Archeus himself ; how shall sweet odours and incenses prevent the poyson , especially if the very excellentest of sweet smels , are also capable of receiving a pestilent contagion ? Therefore let it be a part of Christian piety and compassion , studiously to contemplate with me , how blockishly and unexactly so many Simples have been heaped up together for preserving , and curing ; and how much their unfaithful succours have deluded ten thousands of men , and their expectations ; because they have every where mocked mankind in a true remedy , by reason of the grosse ignorance of causes : For indeed a curative remedy of the plague being present , presupposeth that which a preservative remedy prevents for the future : Therefore a proper curative remedy is convenient onely , as by slaying of the product ( which is the pestilent poyson it self ) it annihilates it in the matter wherein it re ∣ sides : In the next place also , another curative remedy being conjoyned with it , is employ ∣ ed in expelling the subject of the poyson it self , which is to be attempted by - sweat : Moreover , a third is that which takes away and lessens the co - suiting of causes unto their products , the which also hath in it the nature of a preservative .	1664	ee018282
frankincense	odours		had onely one daughter , that died , of whom her father ( to shewe the great loue which hee bare vnto her ) made such a monument for her buriall , that it past all the burials of the kings of Egypt : hee caused a coffine of the likenes of an oxe to be made , set ouer all with golde , wherein hee layed his daughter , and hanged the same vp from the ground in his pallace at the citie of Sai , where euery day the priestes came with frankincense and other sweete odours , to doe sacrifice : the oxe of Apis , which was the God of Memphis , and the Apis .	1590	ee018331
this grain of Incense	perfume		What tho ' I meet with injuries and affronts , hardships and inconveni ∣ ences , being now in a Forreign Country , and every day I live , one Days journey nearer my Eternal Home ! Shall I not patiently bear momentany Sorrows , while I believe I am hastening to Eternal Joy ? Did I look more to the Everlasting World , should not I make the pleasing of God , in order to my Eternal welfare , the great business of my Life ? Should I not serve the Lord with more fervency of Spirit , and be better fortified against the fears of Man , who can but hurt and kill the Body , nor that neither , with ∣ out the permission of God ? Shuld I not order all my affairs , answer all Tempta ∣ tions , mortifie inward Lusts , live in the Exercise of Grace , and in circumspect persevering Obedience , in order to it ? Should I not watch more over my Heart , and Lips , and Ways , be more diligent to trim my Lamps , more crucified to this world , more careful to call my self fre ∣ quently to an account , and renew my Re ∣ pentance ? Would not my Converse be more useful and edifying , my Discourses more savory and full of Religion , my Prayers to God more humble and earnest , my Charity to Men more unfeigned and extensive , and my Preparations every way more suitable to such a Faith , and to such Apprehensions of an Everlasting State ? Could we carry the thoughts of Eternity about with us every day , and often admit them in our civil and secular affairs , did we repeat it frequently to our selves , at least every Morning , as soon as we are awake , that we are near Eterni ∣ ty ; this grain of Incense would perfume the whole Temple , and be an Anti ∣ dote against inward Lust , and impure thoughts , against the infection and defile ∣ ment of bad Company , and the snares of worldly Business , and do much to prevent vain and sensual actions , and to cure vain affections .	1699	ee018449

notwithstanding , all the opposition we meet with , from a wicked perverse World , shut up in darkness ; and because they in the state they are in , cannot comprehend it , therefore they mock , persecute , and blasphem both it , and the vessels thereof , and they would have us to disown the Light , and cease to bear our testi ∣ mony unto it , because they hate the Light themselves , being it re ∣ proves their evil deeds , and makes manifest the hidden things of dishonesty , which they are loath should be known ; therefore they would have the Light quenched , stopt and buried , least their wick ∣ edness be seen , hence it is that people of all Professions , ranks , orders , qualities , and degrees , Rulers , Teachers , Priests , and People , Scribes , Lawyers , Doctors , and Disputers of this World , have and do oppose the Light , and such who testifie of it , least their pride , pomp , ambition , lust , tyranny , deceit , covetousness , and other evil deeds , which are rife among them , should be made manifest , and men of all callings hate the Light ; for deceit , treachery , unrighte ∣ ousness , hath seated and spread it self over all and taken a domini ∣ on in the Earth , and is loath to quit it ; and therefore , it puts into the hearts of all its subjects , to oppose the Light , which if it get foot ∣ ing in the earth , will put a period to its raign , and finish transgres ∣ sion , and bring in everlasting Righteousness : And the Devil sets men upon the opposing the Light , least it bind him , and cast him out of his place , and spoile his house , and break his Kingdom , dashing it as a potters vessel into pieces ; and the Whore mystery Babylon , the mother of Fornications hates the Light , and puts into the hearts of the Kings and powers of the earth , to make war with the Lamb , the Light and the Children of it ; for that is it which discovers the cup of her Fornications and sorceries unto men , and makes manifest her whorish mire whereby she may be discerned , and when she is known the same Kings and Princes and great ones on the earth , who upheld her , shall come to loath and hate her , and burn her flesh with fire ; and now glory to the Lord who hath shewed us Light , and placed it in our hearts , and hath raised and is raising it up , over all opposi ∣ tion whatsoever in us , and by this Light we have discovered the Whore , the Antichrist , the Beast , the Dragon the subtle Serpent , the false Prophet , with all their subtle workings , and deceivableness of unrighteousness ; we have seen the Land of graven Images , and the wilderness where there is no way ; we have so long walked in ; hungry , and thirsty , and our souls fainting in us , and our tongue fail ∣ ing with thirst ; and the light hath given us an out - gate , & amp ; shewed us an entrance into the way of life , and path of righteousness & amp ; holiness , which the Vultures eye can never reach ; & amp ; this path at the beginning appeared to us very strait , & amp ; narrow & amp ; difficult for passage , so that many times sore doubtings and fears arise in us , lest we should ne ∣ ver get thereinto , and many temptations have we indured from the suggestions of the great enemy of our salvation ; saying to us , it is in vain to attempt an entrance , but now blessed be the God of our salvation , an entrance , yea , an abundant entrance is ministred to us thereinto , and the path is becoming more and more easie and spa ∣ cious , and delectable , the way of pleasantness , and the path of peace is opened , and opening , wherein the wayfaring man ( though a fool ) cannot erre or stray ; and the Light hath brought us to Ia ∣ cob ' s Well , where we have found an eternal never fading spring of living water streaming forth into our souls and hearts , to our un ∣ speakable joy , comfort , and satisfaction ; and it hath brought us in ∣ to Bethel , the house of God , the house of prayer ; and we have been made joyful therein , according to the Lord ' s promise ; and in this house and Temple of God , we have seen the glory of the Lord , and had Isaiah ' s Vision , beholding him sitting upon a throne , high and lifted up , and his train filling the Temple ; and we have heard the voice , Holy , holy , holy , Lord God of Hosts , the whole earth is full of his glory ; and we have been made to cry , woe is us , for we are undone , because of uncleanness , and fear and trembling hath taken hold of us , so that the posts of the door lyes moved and shaken , at the voice of him that cryed ; and the Angel hath flown unto us , having a live coal in his hand , taken in the tongs from off the Altar , and therewith hath touched our lips , saying unto us , your iniquity is taken away , and your sin purged ; and in his Tem ∣ ple we have talked of the glory of the Lord , and of his loving kind ∣ ness one unto another ; and we have blessed and praised the Name of the Lord , for his mercy and goodness to the children of men ; and we have eat and drunk in the house of our God , in the moun ∣ tain of his holiness have we been entertained with the feast of fat things , full of marrow , of wines on the lees well refined ; and we have seen the King in his beauty , and bread hath been given to us , and our water made sure , and it faileth not , which we drink every one out of our own Cestern ; and the glorious Lord hath become unto us a place of broad Rivers ; and we have been brought to the Shepherds tents , and seen where he feedeth the flock , and causeth it to rest at noon ; and we have loved the Pasture dearly , and in ∣ treated the Shepherd that he would make us partake with the flock , and lead us to the green field and Paradice of his pleasure , and to the streams of that river which is full of water , and floweth rich ∣ ly forth , to the continual gladning of the City of God ; and we have desired it of him with the earnest of our souls , that we might see the good of his chosen , and be remembred with the favour he bears to his people , and gladned with the joy of his Nation , that we might have whereby to glory with his inheritance ; and the Lord hath heard and granted the breathings of our souls ; we ask ∣ ed life of him , and he hath given it us , and put a crown of pure gold upon our heads , even a crown of righteousness , and eternal life ; and he hath put a new song of praise to him who lives for ever and ever , in our mouths , which none can sing , no nor understand , but such as are redeemed from off the earth ; and Palms of Victory in our hands are given to us , and Harps wherewith to harp , and make melody to the God of our life , who hath created us anew in Jesus Christ , unto good works ; and Censers full of incense , which are the prayers of the Saints ; and the Lord hath not suffered , does not suffer us , to want any good thing , he openeth his hands plentifully , and filleth us with his blessing , and giveth us to drink of the River of his pleasure , and the wine which groweth in our fathers King ∣ dom ; and how great is his goodness ! how great is his beauty ! for Corn hath made the young - men glad , and new wine the Maids , as it is written , and the mountains have dropped down the wine , and the Fatts and Wine - presses have overflowed , and the Heavens have opened , and poured down everlasting righteousness , and rained the showers of blessing upon the tender herbs of the Lords planting in the earth ; and loe the Winter is past , the rain is over and gone , and the Spring is come , wherein the birds do sweetly sing , and the voice of the Turtle is heard in our Land ; and the Fig - tree putteth forth its blossoms , and green figs and others are come , and coming to perfection and maturity ;

And what , I ask , was the charm which forced Jupiter to leave the all - important direction of the universe , and appear at the bidding of mortals ? the sacrificial meal , incense , blood , the scent of burning laurel - boughs , and muttering of spells ? And were all these more powerful than Jupiter , so that they compelled him to do unwillingly what was enjoined , or to give himself up of his own accord to their crafty tricks ?

But if it is unlawful to be spoken , and is not to be thought possible , that that which you see to be most in accordance with reason was not established on account of some reason of importance , what reason can there be in these errors of depraved religions , and in this persuasion of philosophers , by which they imagine that souls perish ? Assuredly there is none ; for what have they to say why the gods so regularly supply to men everything in its season ? Is it that we may present to them corn and wine , and the odour of incense , and the blood of cattle ? Which things cannot be acceptable to the immortals , because they are perishable ; nor can they be of use to beings destitute of bodies , because these things have been given for the use of those possessed of bodies ; and yet if they required these things , they could bestow them upon themselves when they wished .	1885	wi12900

For where the giver is venal and mercenary , there it must needs be that favour is granted according to the greatness of the gift by which it is purchased , and that a favourable decision is given to him from whom far the greater reward and bribe , though this be shameful , flows to him who gives it .	1885	wi12900

But if we allow that this is the case , we make them subject to the conditions of humanity , and shut them out from the limits of deity ; for whatever breathes and draws in draughts of air , to be sent back in the same way , must be mortal , because it is sustained by feeding on the atmosphere .	1885	wi12900

fuming with myself after for giving in only for I knew he was gone on me and the first socialist he said He was he annoyed me so much I couldnt put him into a temper still he knows a lot of mixed up things especially about the body and the insides I often wanted to study up that myself what we have inside us in that family physician I could always hear his voice talking when the room was crowded and watch him after that I pretended I had on a coolness with her over him 695 mass or meeting he says your soul you have no soul inside only grey matter because he doesnt know what it is to have one yes when I lit the lamp yes because he must have come 3 or 4 times with that tremendous big red brute of a thing he has I thought the vein or whatever the dickens they call it was going to because he used to be a bit on the jealous side whenever he asked who are you going to and I said over to Floey and he made me the present of lord Byrons poems and the three pairs of gloves so that finished that I could quite easily get him to make it up any time I know how Id even supposing he got in with her again and was going out to see her somewhere Id know if he refused to eat the onions I know plenty of ways ask him to tuck down the collar of my blouse or touch him with my veil and gloves on going out 1 kiss then wouldsend them all spinning however alright well see then let him go to her she of course would only be too delighted to pretend shes mad in love with him that I wouldnt so much mind Id just go to her and ask her do you love him and look her square in the eyes she couldnt fool me but he might imagine he was and make a declaration with his plabbery kind of a manner to her like he did to me though I had the devils own job to get it out of him though I liked him for that it showed he could hold in and wasnt to be got for the asking he was on the pop of asking me too the night in the kitchen I was rolling the potato cake theres something I want to say to you only for I put him off letting on I was in a temper with my hands and arms full of pasty flour in any case I let out too much the night before talking of dreams so I didnt want to let him know more than was good for him she used to be always embracing me Josie whenever he was there meaning him of course glauming me over and when I said I washed up and down as far as possible asking me did you wash possible the women are always egging on to that putting it on thick when hes there they know by his sly eye blinking a bit putting on the indifferent when they come out with something the kind he is what spoils him I dont wonder in the least because he was very handsome at that time trying to look like lord Byron I said I liked though he was too beautiful for a man and he was a little before we got engaged afterwards though she didnt like it so much the day I was in fits of laughing with the giggles I couldnt stop about all my hairpins falling one after another with the mass of hair I had youre always in great humour she said yes because it grigged her because she knew what it meant because I used to tell her a good bit of what went on between us not all but just enough to make her month water but that wasnt my fault she didnt darken the door much after we were married I wonder what shes got like now 695 mass or meeting he says your soul you have no soul inside only grey matter

where the eunuchs , who take charge of the sacred women , have , moreover , their lips and noses cut off , that they may not be loved ; where the priests put out their own eyes , to be better acquainted with their demons , and the better to receive their oracles ; where every one makes to himself a deity of what he likes best ; the hunter of a lion or a fox , the fisher of some fish ; idols of every human action or passion ; in which place , the sun , the moon , and the earth are the ' principal deities , and the form of taking an oath is , to touch the earth , looking up to heaven ;

where , when the king , to betake himself wholly to devotion , retires from his administration ( which often falls out ) , his next successor is obliged to do the same , and the right of the kingdom devolves to the third in succession : where they vary the form of government , according to the seeming necessity of affairs : depose the king when they think good , substituting certain elders to govern in his stead , and sometimes transferring it into the hands of the commonality : where men and women are both circumcised and also baptized : where the soldier , who in one or several engagements , has been so fortunate as to present seven of the enemies ' heads to the king , is made noble : where they live in that rare and unsociable opinion of the mortality of the soul : where the women are delivered without pain or fear : where the women wear copper leggings upon both legs , and if a louse bite them , are bound in magnanimity to bite them again , and dare not marry , till first they have made their king a tender of their virginity , if he please to accept it : where the ordinary way of salutation is by putting a finger down to the earth , and then pointing it up toward heaven : where men carry burdens upon their heads , and women on their shoulders ; where the women make water standing , and the men squatting : where they send their blood in token of friendship , and offer incense to the men they would honour , like gods : where , not only to the fourth , but in any other remote degree , kindred are not permitted to marry : where the children are four years at nurse , and often twelve ; in which place , also , it is accounted mortal to give the child suck the first day after it is born : where the correction of the male children is peculiarly designed to the fathers , and to the mothers of the girls ; the punishment being to hang them by the heels in the smoke : where they circumcise the women : where they eat all sorts of herbs , without other scruple than of the badness of the smell : where all things are open the finest houses , furnished in the richest manner , without doors , windows , trunks , or chests to lock , a thief being there punished double what they are in other places : where they crack lice with their teeth like monkeys , and abhor to see them killed with one ' s nails : where in all their lives they neither cut their hair nor pare their nails ; and , in another place , pare those of the right hand only , letting the left grow for ornament and bravery : where they suffer the hair on the right side to grow as long as it will , and shave the other ; and in the neighbouring provinces , some let their hair grow long before , and some behind , shaving close the rest : where parents let out their children , and husbands their wives , to their guests to hire : where a man may get his own mother with child , and fathers make use of their own daughters or sons , without scandal : where , at their solemn feasts , they interchangeably lend their children to one another , without any consideration of nearness of blood .	1877	wi6186
