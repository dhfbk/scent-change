# Perception shift in the Olfactory Domain

This repository contains material used to perform the analysis of perception shifts in the olfactory domain presented in the following paper:


> T. Paccosi, S. Menini, E. Leonardelli, I. Barzon and S. Tonelli: **Scent and Sensibility: Perception Shifts in the Olfactory Domain** (2023). *In Proceedings of 4th International Workshop on Computational Approaches to Historical Language Change 2023 (LChange 2023)*. 

The files are oganized in 3 folders:

### Benchmark

A manually created benchmark with 16 smell sources. For every source the type of perception shift (shift type) and the periods in which the shift occurs are provided (periods 1-3). For each period, we also provide a description of the main characterization of the smell underlining the possible shift occurring in that time window (topic period 1-3).  

### Data Raw

The folder contains all the frame elements and sentences in which the 5 smell sources we considered in our analysis (candle, ozone, incense, glove, and tobacco) are labelled as smell sources in the corpus. 

### Embeddings

Contains two files with the vectors of each smell source in the time span used in the paper. 

- a file containing the vectors generated from the frame elements

- a file generated from all the text in the corpus
